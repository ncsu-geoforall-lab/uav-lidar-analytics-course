<h2>Flight plan preparation</h2>


Considering the technical, meteorological and legal conditions of the
possible flight area choice, you shouldnâ€™t forget about the most
important element: the aim and purpose of the flight.

<p>
In this assigment you need to justify the choice of the flight area and
prove that the geographical aln legal conditions allow for a save
flight execution. 

<p>
If you need you can attach to the assignment a photo, figure or map.
