<h2>Geoprocessing of the UAS data</h2>

<p>Completing this assignment you will generate orthomosaic and Digital
Surface Model using pictures taken from the UAS Trimble UX5 Rover
(Flight mission executed on June 20<sup>th</sup> 2015). The Study area
is located at
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zi8EsFDQAyqo.kr7lL7Germeo">Lake Wheeler COA</a>. Additionally you will be able to see the processing
results in the generated report and optionally you will be able to
export also 3D model and Point cloud as well as Camera calibration and
orientation data.</p>

<p>The process can be very time consuming
(depending on computational power of your device and desired quality) so if
you are unable to execute the whole step the intermediate results are
provided in the separate project files<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXfm9DOEZpYWwyZTFJX040em90NFZMQ3o5amdUSmtZdGRMeFp1VXNzakpOTVk"> here</a></p>

<p>In order to minimize the processing time, we will process only fraction of the data collected and we will use imagery downsampled by 50%. It will allow us to generate outputs in the classroom. The resolution of ortophoto and DSM will be lower,  but the high quality and full extent files are provided in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXfmZPRHlYSTNIZzdpRVBzay04c0VXUjM4Nzlmbjl5WDlrcGs1bFVLczlTd1k"> GRASS location</a></p>

<p>General tab:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Leave default
        (optional – white log to file: enabled, if you want to save the txt log file)
</ul>

<p>OpenCL TAB:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Check on any OpenCL devices detected by PhotoScan in the dialog
        and reduce the number of active CPU cores by one for each OpenCL
        device enabled.
</ul>

<p>Advanced tab:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Project compression level: 6

<h3>Stage 1: Building simple geometry (in order to place GCPs)</h3>

<p>In order to localize the GCPs first a preliminary simple model needs to be build.</p>


<h4>Adding photos</h4>

<p>Menu &gt;  Workflow &gt; Add Photos</p>

<p>Indicate the path to the folder (downloaded data) containing photos
and select them all.</p> <p>In the Reference panel, you can see that
the photos has been loaded, but the coordinate system indicates local
coordinates. It can be changed in the Settings.</p> <p>Click the
settings icon <img src="img/geoprocessing/settings_icon.png" class="icon">
&gt;  change coordinate system to WGS
84</p>

<figure>

</figure>


<h4>Loading camera positions</h4>

<p>Click Import button <img src="img/geoprocessing/import_icon.png" class="icon">
on the Reference pane toolbar &gt; select file
containing camera positions information (log file*) in the Open
dialog.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/import_csv.png">
</figure>

<p>*Agisoft support the camera orientation files in 5 formats: .csv,
.txt, .tel, .xml and and .log. The default format of the Trimble Aerial Imaging log is .jxl. In order to convert the Trimble .jxl log
file please use <a href="https://github.com/wenzeslaus/jxl2csv">script by Vaclav Petras</a> or use provided already converted log in .txt format</p>

<p>Make sure that the columns are named properly – you can adjust their
placement by indicating column number (top right of dialog box)</p>


<h4>Aligning photos</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Accuracy: High
    <li>Pair preselection: Reference
    <li>Key point limit: 40000
    <li>Tie point limit: 1000
</ul>

<p>Menu &gt; Workflow &gt; Align Photos</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/align_photos.png">
</figure>
<p>Click Save <img src="img/geoprocessing/save_icon.png" class="icon"> in the toolbar</p>


<h3>Building dense point cloud (for rapid processing)</h3>

<p>Menu &gt; Workflow &gt; Build Dense Point Cloud</p>

<ul>
    <li>Quality: Lowest
    <li>Depth filtering: Aggressive
</ul>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/build_dense_cloud.png">
</figure>
<p>Click Save <img src="img/geoprocessing/save_icon.png" class="icon"> in the toolbar</p>


<h3>Stage 2: Placing GCPs</h3>


<h4>Loading the GCPs coordinates</h4>

<p>Click Import button <img src="img/geoprocessing/import_icon.png" class="icon">
on the Reference pane toolbar &gt; select file
containing Ground Control Points coordinates in the Open dialog</p>

<p>Make sure that the columns are named properly – you can adjust their
placement by indicating column number (top right of dialog box). Notice
that the file contains Easting and Northing values, which are NOT
latitude and longitude</p>

<p>This time you disable the <em>Load orientation</em> option since GCPs are
stationary and do not need determining yaw pitch and roll angles.</p>

<p>The window with the message: <em>Can’t find match for ‘UAV 1’ entry.
Create new marker?</em>  will pop up.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/no_match_new_marker.png">
</figure>

<p>Choose ‘Yes to All’ – it will create new marker for each of the
named GCPs from the file. They will be listed in Reference pane under
the list of photos.</p>


<h4>Indicating GCPs on the pictures</h4>

<p>Now you need to find each of the GCPs and indicate its localization
on all photos depicting it.</p>

<p>The sample used for this processing do not cover all the GCPs. The
Mode pane shows approximate positions of GCPs, it is better visible if
the ‘Show cameras’ option is disabled (Menu &gt; View &gt; Show/Hide
Items &gt; Show cameras)</p>

<p>
<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/gcps_cameras.png">
<img src="img/geoprocessing/gcps_photo.png"></p>
</figure>

<p>Choose in the context menu of the selected point on the list (right
click)  &gt;  Filter Photos by Marker. If the marker does not appear on any photo (the list of thumbnail is empty) it means that it is located outside of our sample area and you can remove this Marker (right click &gt; Remove Marker). You should end up with 4 markers</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/filter_photos_by_marker.png">
</figure>

<p>In the Photos pane
appear only the images in which the currently selected GCP is probably
visible.</p>

<p>Open an image by double clicking the thumbnail. It will open in a
tab next to the Model pane.</p>

<p>The GCP will appear as a grey icon
<img src="img/geoprocessing/gcp_gray.png" class="icon">.
This icon needs to be moved to the middle of GCP visible on the photo</p>

<figure class="large">
<img src="img/geoprocessing/gcp_reposition.png">
</figure>

<p>Drag the marker to the correct measurement position. At that point,
the marker will appear as a green flag, meaning it is enabled and will
be used for further processing.</p>

<p>Double click on the next photo and repeat the steps. As soon as the
GCP marker position has already been indicated on at two images, the
proposed position will almost exactly match the point of measurement.
You can now slightly drag the marker to enable it (turning it into a
green flag) or leave it unchanged (gray marker icon) to exclude it from
processing.</p>

<p>Filter photos my each marker again. Agisoft adjusts the GCP posisions on the run, so you can locate the GCP on additional images that will appear in the Photos pane.</p>

<p>In this sample processing we will include 4 GCPs. Mathematically, you need to indicate marker positions for at least 3
GCPs. Accurate error estimates can be calculated with at least 4 GCPs,
while often at least 5 are needed to cover the center of the project as
well, which reduces the chance of error propagation and resulting
terrain distortions especially on flat or undulating terrain types.</p>

<p>Click Save <img src="img/geoprocessing/save_icon.png" class="icon"> in the toolbar</p>


<h4>Optimizing alignment</h4>

<p>You can see the errors by clicking on the View Errors icon
<img src="img/geoprocessing/view_errors_icon.png" class="icon"></p>
<p>Best results are obtained when the alignment is first optimized based on the camera coordinates only, and a second time based on the GCP only.</p>


<h4>Optimizing based on the camera coordinates</h4>

<p>In the Ground Control pane:</p>

<ul>
    <li>disable all the GCP Marker coordinates
        (select one &gt; press Ctrl+A &gt; right-click &gt; choose Uncheck).
    <li>enable all the camera coordinates
        (select one &gt; press Ctrl+A &gt; right-click &gt; choose Check).
</ul>

<p>Click Settings icon <img src="img/geoprocessing/settings_icon.png" class="icon"> in the Ground Control toolbar:</p>

<ul>
    <li>set Camera accuracy (m) = 1,
    <li>leave the rest at default values,
</ul>

<p>Click Optimize icon <img src="img/geoprocessing/optimize_icon.png" class="icon"> in the Ground Control toolbar (leave all options at the default)</p>


<h4>Optimizing based on the GCP Markers</h4>

<p>In the Ground Control pane:</p>

<ul>
    <li>disable all the camera coordinates
        (select one &gt; press Ctrl+A &gt; right-click &gt; choose Uncheck).
    <li>enable all the GCP Marker coordinates
        (select one &gt; press Ctrl+A &gt; right-click &gt; choose Check).
</ul>

<p>Click Settings icon <img src="img/geoprocessing/settings_icon.png" class="icon"> in the Ground Control toolbar:</p>

<ul>
    <li>set Marker accuracy (m) = 0.001m
    <li>leave the rest at default values,
</ul>

<p>click Optimize icon <img src="img/geoprocessing/optimize_icon.png" class="icon"> in the Ground Control toolbar (leave all options at the default)</p>
<p>Click Save <img src="img/geoprocessing/save_icon.png" class="icon"> in the toolbar</p>
<p>You can now seehow much the errors were reduced through optimization by clicking on the View Errors icon
<img src="img/geoprocessing/view_errors_icon.png" class="icon"></p>


<h3>Stage 3: Building complex geometry (for quality processing)</h3>


<p>Before starting the Build Geometry step it is recommended to check
the bounding box of the reconstruction (to make sure that it includes
the whole region of interest, in all dimensions). The bounding box
should also not be too large (increased processing time and memory
requirements).</p>

<p>The bounding box can be adjusted using the Resize Region
<img src="img/geoprocessing/resize_region.png" class="icon"> and the Rotate Region
<img src="img/geoprocessing/rotate_region.png" class="icon"> tool from the
toolbar. Make sure that the base (red plane) is at the bottom.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/rotated_view.png">
</figure>

<p>The next steps will be time consuming (depending on the desired
quality and number of pictures).You can execute them one step at the
time, what would be explained below. You can also set a batch
processing that does not require user interaction until the end of
geoprocessing (especially useful in case of Ultra High quality that
requires even several days of processing). The batch processing will be
explained at the end of this section.</p>

<p>Menu &gt; Workflow &gt;  Build Dense Cloud</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quality* =
        <ul>
            <li>Medium (will downsample the images to get a 3D coordinate every 4
            <li>High (will downsample the images to get a 3D coordinate every 2 pixels;
                pixels; typically takesseveral hours but will give acceptable results for
                most cases),
                typically takes >10-20 hours) or
            <li>Ultra high (will calculate a 3D coordinate for every pixel in original
                imagery; may take more than a day or several days)
        </ul>
    <li>Depth filtering = Aggressive
</ul>

<p>*Take into consideration the RAM size requirements for the different
target qualities with respect to the number of images (in appendix or
in lecture slides).</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/build_dense_cloud_medium_aggressive.png">
</figure>

<p>Click Save <img src="img/geoprocessing/save_icon.png" class="icon"> in the toolbar</p>

<p>Menu &gt; Workflow &gt;  Build Mesh</p>

<ul>
    <li>Surface type: Height field
    <li>Source data: Dense cloud
    <li>Face count*: Custom: 50 000 000
    <li>Advanced options: leave default
</ul>

<p>*Face count set at “0” means that PhotoScan will determine an
optimum number of faces (but this may not be enough to describe all the
features on terrain)</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/build_mesh.png">
</figure>

<p>Menu &gt; Workflow &gt;  Build Texture</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mapping mode: Orthophoto
    <li>Blending mode: Mosaic (default)
    <li>Texture size/count: 4096
    <li>Enable color correction: disabled (unchecked)
</ul>

<p>Click Save <img src="img/geoprocessing/save_icon.png" class="icon"> in the toolbar</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/build_texture.png">
</figure>

<h4>Editing geometry</h4>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to edit geometry before building texture
atlas and exporting the model.</p>

<p>If the overlap of the original images was not sufficient, the model
can contain holes. In this case to obtain holeless model use Close
Holes command</p>

<p>Menu &gt;  Tools  &gt;  Mesh  &gt;  Close Holes</p>

<p>In Close Holes dialog select the size of the largest hole to be
closed (in percentage of the total model size).</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/close_holes.png">
</figure>

<p>This does not apply to our data, since we have sufficient image
overlap. But due to strong dependency on weather conditions, the holes
in data are common with UAS.</p>

<h4>Batch processing</h4>

<p>Menu &gt;  Workflow &gt;  Batch process  &gt; Add</p>

<p>
Batch processing allows to set multiple process
in the preset order and execute it one after another without user
intervention. All the parameters should be set the same as explained
above.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Build dense point cloud
    <li>Build Mesh
    <li>Decimate Mesh
    <li>Build Texture
</ol>

<figure>
<img src="img/geoprocessing/batch_process.png">
<img src="img/geoprocessing/edit_job.png">
</figure>

<p>
If the process takes really long time on your device, you can cancel the processing and work with the project files saved on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXfm9DOEZpYWwyZTFJX040em90NFZMQ3o5amdUSmtZdGRMeFp1VXNzakpOTVk"> google drive</a> (after each time consuming step, the project file was saved and you can work starting from this step). The only adjustment you need to make is to change the path of the pictures to the localization of downloaded images on your computer.<br>In order to do that right clik on any of the pictures in the Pictures pane and choose <em>Change Path...</em> and in the dialog window mark the <em>All cameras</em> option. This will automatically apply the updated location to all the pictures in the project.</p>
