</ul> 

<h4>Data:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZYDVwZD04RQ_JNnWmQzmPn4TMf8H4dHh">Imagery from 02/06/2018 Lake Wheeler flight</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H5xW4-n1cw7JtbZXzvaL3iVAwYocfcGk">Agisoft project files</a> with processed data

<h3>Performing measurements on a model</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Data preparation</h4>
In the first part of the assignment you will be working with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZYDVwZD04RQ_JNnWmQzmPn4TMf8H4dHh">data from 02/06/2018 Lake Wheeler flight</a>. Because the processing is very time consuming, the processed data (stored in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H5xW4-n1cw7JtbZXzvaL3iVAwYocfcGk">Agisoft project files</a>) is provided. <br>
After opening the <strong>2010_02_06_assignment.psx</strong> file, you should see generated orthomosaic and DSM in the Workspace pane. <br>All you have to do is to indicate the new location of the pictures. <br>
In order to do that right clik on any of the pictures in the Pictures pane and choose <em>Change Path...</em> and in the dialog window mark the <em>All cameras</em> option. This will automatically apply the updated location to all the pictures in the project.</p>

<h4>Distance measurement:</h4>
<p>Using the Ruler instrument for the toolbar menu calculate the length of the longer side of the bigger building.</p>

<h4>Distance between GCPs:</h4>
<p>To measure distance between two markers in Agisoft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select both markers to be used for distance measurements on the Reference pane using <em>Ctrl</em> button
<li>Select Create Scale Bar command form the 3D view context menu. The scale bar will be created and an instant added to the Scale Bar list on the Reference pane. 
</ul><br>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> in order to see the estimated values, you need to be in the estimates display - on the Reference pane, following button needs to be active

<p>Compare distance between <strong>UAV 9</strong> and <strong>UAV 12</strong> estimated by Agisoft Photoscan with the distance calculated from coordinates:

<table class="schedule">

<thead>
<tr>
<th>GCP</th>
<th>Easting <em>[m]</em></th>
<th>Northing <em>[m]</em></th>
<th>ASL <em>[m]</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td><strong>UAV 9</strong></td>
<td>636744.300</td>
<td>219381.308</td>
<td>109.971</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>UAV 12</strong></td>
<td>637057.310</td>
<td>219733.909</td>
<td>116.12</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to take into account elevation difference in your calculations. <em>Show your work</em><br>
How much (in meters/percentage) do these values differ?</p>

<h4>Distance between cameras</h4>
<p>To measure distance between two cameras in Agisoft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the two cameras on the Workspace or Reference pane using <em>Ctrl</em> button. Alternatively, the cameras can be selected in the Model view window using selecting tools from the Toolbar.
<li>Select Create Scale Bar command form the 3D view context menu. The scale bar will be created and an instant added to the Scale Bar list on the Reference pane. 
</ul>
<p>Measure distance between  cameras <strong>DSC03341</strong> and <strong>DSC03752</strong>.

</ul>

<h3>Performing measurements on DSMs</h3>
<p>Switch to Ortho view (double click on the Orthomosaic in the Workspace pane)
<ul>

<h4>Point and distance measurement:</h4>
<p>In the western part of the area, close to the forest edge, there are some sheaves</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Ruler instrument or Draw Polyline from the Toolbar of the Ortho view estimate the diameter and height of the very north sheaf.
</ul>

<h4>Contours:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Select <em>Generate Contours...</em> command from Tools menu.
<li>Set round values for Minimal altitude, Maximal altitude parameters as well as the Interval for the contours.
<li>Set the transparency for the contours for 50% and do not display the labels. (You can do it in <em>Preferences</em> in the Contours context menu in the Workspace pane (contours are in the Shapes folder)
</ul>

<h4>Cross section:</h4>
<p>Choose some interesting place for cross section (you can see from the contours where are some variations in terrain)</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicate a line to make a cut of the model using Draw Polyline tool from the Ortho view toolbar (double click ends the line).
<li>Right button click on the polyline/polygon and select <em>Measure...</em> command from the context menu.
<li>Include in the report your profile with the and its location.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Volume  and area measurements</h3>
<ul>

<p>In this part of the assignment you will be working with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZYDVwZD04RQ_JNnWmQzmPn4TMf8H4dHh">imagery acquired 07/02/2017 at Wake Waste Transfer</a>. <br>
<strong> Calculate the volume and the area of the "waste pile" </strong>(for excact location see <a hreef="https://goo.gl/maps/hkYqDxZHcpT2">google maps</a>)

<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>follow the Agisoft Photoscann  <a href="http://www.agisoft.com/pdf/PS_1.1_Tutorial%20(IL)%20-%20Volume%20measurements.pdf">tutorial on volume measurements</a>
<li>the delimitation of the pile is up to you - you can examine whatever part of the pile you want to process
<li>use a high (or custom) face count setting in mesh generation to have detailed mesh
<li>remember to close mesh holes (level 100%)
<li>you can additionally generate contours 
</ul>
</ul>
