<h2>Mapping and Analytics Using UAS</h2>

<h3>Course description</h3>

The course starts with a brief overview of the UAS mapping technology and its rules and regulations.
The principles of UAS data collection are explained along with hands-on
practice in flight planning and execution. The main focus of this course is on processing 
the collected imagery using structure from motion technique and deriving orthophoto mosaics 
and ultra-high resolution digital elevation models of land surface, vegetation and structures.
More advanced topics include multitemporal 3D data analysis, fusion with lidar data 
and 3D visualization with applications in natural resources.

The course covers monitoring, analysis, and modeling of 3D landscape change
using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and lidar data.
The principles of UAS data collection, processing of 3D point clouds and
the resulting terrain models are explained, followed by
hands-on experience with multitemporal data collected by the NCSU NextGen Air
Transportation (NGAT) program. The course also covers techniques for analysis
and visualization of point cloud data and 3D modeling.
lidar data time series and outputs of dynamic simulations,
including immersive visualization at the Hunt library facilities.
The students will also have the opportunity to work with the Tangible Landscape system
to explore impact of 3D terrain change on landscape parameters and processes.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

None, but GIS/MEA582 and/or GIS540 or equivalent courses are highly recommended.

<h3>Educational approach</h3>

This course will consist of: lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, 
homework assignments, and a major project. All the work will be collected 
within an electronic portfolio that will systematically include the work that you will do
for this and other GIS courses. Extra credits will be given for innovative solutions, 
creativity in problem solving and extensions to given tasks.
