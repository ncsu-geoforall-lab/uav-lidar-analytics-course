    <h2>Visible spectrum – RGB cameras</h2>
<ul>
<li>The human eye is sensitive only to wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, which is known as the visible spectrum. Humans can perceive a variety of colors ranging from violet to red.  Wavelengths however can also be shorter (ultraviolet) or longer (infrared) than those of our visible eyesight.</li>
<li>Even though we cannot see them, these invisible wavebands are very indicative of the agronomic characteristics of soil, plants and crops.</li>

    <h2>Multispectral sensors</h2>
    <ul>
		<li class="fragment">Advances in multispectral sensors for drones have led to a rapid growth in their use for capturing not only visible spectra (e.g., red, green, and blue bands, hereafter referred to as RGB but also bands outside the visible spectra such as near-infrared (NIR) and red-edge (REG) channels (the red edge is located between the red and NIR portions of the electromagnetic spectrum).</li>
		<li class="fragment">Multispectral sensors flown onboard UAS provide data that are spectrally similar to imagery captured from satellites and manned aircraft – putting a very powerful tool into the hands of users.</li>

    <h2>Generating a reflectance map from a multispectral drone</h2>
<ul>
		<li class="fragment">The at-sensor reflectance (i.e., radiance), which is the radiant flux received by the sensor, is a function of the surface radiance and the atmospheric disturbance between the surface and the sensor.</li>
		<li class="fragment">This can be calibrated by a reflectance standard to an absolute reflectance signature stored as numeric digital number values in the image. The output is a reflectance map/imagery with multiple bands</li>

    <h2>Green band</h2>
    <ul>
		<li class="small fragment">corresponds to the reflected energy in the 500 to 600 nm spectral band and has the greatest reflectance of a plant in this band. The reflectance peak is at around 550 nm. It has been proven that this spectral band is strongly correlated with the amount of chlorophyll contained in the plant.</li>
		<li class="small fragment">In this visible portion of the vegetation spectrum, the reflectance curve of a healthy plant exhibits the greatest reflectance in a green waveband (in the range of 550 nm). This is why plants appear green to us.</li>
		<li class="small fragment">IA chemical compound in leaves called chlorophyll strongly absorbs radiation in the red and blue wavelengths but reflects green wavelengths. Leaves appear “greenest” to us in the summer, when chlorophyll content is at its maximum.</li>
		</ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Red band</h2>
    <ul>
		<li class="fragment">Corresponds to the reflected energy in the 600 – 700 nm spectral band. The strong chlorophyll absorption in this band results in a low reflectance. Reflectance varies significantly in relation to factors such as biomass, LAI (Leaf Area Index), soil history, crop type, humidity and plant stress.</li>
		<li class="fragment">For most crops this band gives an excellent contrast between the plants and the soil and it is extensively used for compiling most of the vegetation indices in agriculture.

<h2>Red Edge</h2>
<div class="left">  
<ul> 
<li class="small fragment">This a very narrow band (700 – 730 nm), which corresponds to the entry point of Near Infrared. It is the point of sudden change in reflectance, from strong absorption of Red to substantial reflection of Near Infrared. This band is very sensitive to plant stress and provides information on the chlorophyll.

    <h2>NIR (Near-Infrared)</h2>
    <ul>
		<li class="small fragment">Corresponds to the wavelengths in the 700 nm to 1.3 µm range, has the strongest reflectance of the bands studied. There is a very strong correlation between this reflectance and the level of chlorophyll in the plant. A highly significant variation of the reflectance in this band is produced when a plant is under stress.</li>
		<li class="small fragment">Healthy vegetation absorbs blue and red-light energy to fuel photosynthesis and create chlorophyll. A plant with more chlorophyll will reflect more near-infrared energy than an unhealthy plant. Thus, analyzing a plants spectrum of both absorption and reflection in visible and in infrared wavelengths can provide information about the plants’ health and productivity.</li>

    <ul>

    <h2>Vegetation indices</h2>
    <ul>
		<li class="fragment">Reflectance maps can be used to calculate a variety of spectral indices. Spectral indices are a form of image enhancement where the bands are mathematically combined or transformed to permit better interpretation of the information in the image.</li>
		<li class="fragment">Since the 1970s, many indices have been developed for different scientific purposes. The most common spectral indices are vegetation indices (VIs) that highlight the biophysical characteristics of the vegetation and are sensitive to photosynthetic activity, canopy structure, and vegetation composition.</li>
