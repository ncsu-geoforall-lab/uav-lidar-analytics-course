   <h3>UAS for monitoring changes</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">Low cost and rapid deployment: excellent for monitoring changes at local scale (fields, small watersheds)
<p>
<ul>
   <li class="fragment">crop monitoring: growth, disease, stress</li>
   <li class="fragment">erosion processes: coastal, stream bank, rills and gullies</li>
   <li class="fragment">natural disasters: flooding, landslides, fire </li>
   <li class="fragment">mining, construction sites </li>
</ul>
<!--<p><img  height="250" class="fragment" src="img/lidar/midpines_lidar_plasviewcozoom.jpg"></p>-->
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Monitoring design</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">Assess:
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">metrics to quantify changes: relative height, volume, feature migration</li>
    <li class="fragment">spatial resolution needed to capture the changes</li>
    <li class="fragment">temporal resolution: regular intervals, events </li>
    <li class="fragment">accessibility: flying over people, line of sight, suitable GCPs </li>
    <li class="fragment">georeferencing, rectification: GCPs distribution and survey</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Processing time series</h3>
<ul>
<li>analyze and interpolate point clouds: DSMs with aligned, common resolution grids
<li>raster DSMs are more suitable for time series than TIN
<li>use GCPs and permanent features to evaluate accuracy, correct errors and distortions
<li>assign time stamps and register raster DSMs within GIS-based temporal data framework
</ul>

</section>

<section>
 <h3>Temporal data framework</h3>
<ul>
 <li>supports efficient processing, management and analysis of space-time data sets
 <li>space-time dataset is a set of maps (raster, vector) registered in a temporal database
 <li>space-time dataset may represent a dynamic process 
 <li>individual maps represent the states of the dynamic system at a given time
</ul>

   <h3>Time stamp type</h3>
<ul>
 <li>time stamp: assigns time to an individual map in space-time data set
 <li>time instant - snapshot at given time: 2013-10-15 13:00:00 (absolute time)
 <li>time interval - defined by start and end time: day, month, year (relative time)
 <li>a single UAS survey represents a snapshot (state) which can be agreggated into intervals
</ul>

   <h3>Temporal count and intersection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Count: number of maps (temporal snapshots) where the given cell has non-null value (overlap)
<li>Intersection: grid cells with non-null values from each map in time series

   <h3>Basic time series analysis</h3>
<p>
Per cell statistics computed for each cell over the time series:
<ul>
 <li>mean and standard deviation
 <li>min, max elevation and range 
 <li>time at minimum, time at maximum
 <li>linear regression: slopem offset, regr. coefficient
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Basic time series analysis: core, envelope</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Core surface: min. elevation measured for each cell  
 <li>Envelope: max. elevation measured for each cell 
</ul>
<p> Example: cutting plane with lidar, core and envelope

   <h3>Detecting surveys with large distortions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Derive core surface from UAS time series
<li>Compute difference between UAS core and lidar bare ground surface
<li>Compute time of minimum raster to identify the distorted DSMs with elevation well below lidar bare ground
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Corrected UAS core surface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove distorted DSMs from derivation of core surface
<li>Difference between UAS core and lidar bare ground surface is now very small
<li>Hist. equalized color ramp for differences highlights a small shift in lidar swath
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Envelope and range applications</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Envelope: what is the max height of crop in each pixel over the monitored period?
<li>time of maximum - when was the crop highest at each grid cell?
<li>where is the largest range and variability in crop height?
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Envelope and range applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>use envelope to show all cars ever parked at the site
<li>core, snapshot, envelope, surfaces can be used to manage parking area
</ul>
<img width="50%" src="img/timeseries/cars.jpg">

<section>
   <h3>Basic time series analysis: regression</h3>
<ul>
 <li>applies to well designed, systematic monitoring with longer time series, 
 <li>select subset where the changes are close to linear - e.g. crop growth period,
 <li>compute per cell linear regression analysis: map of regression slope and offset 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
 <h3>Map algebra for time series</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>apply map algebra expression for each map in the time series at each grid cell
  <li>output is new time series which is registered as a new space-time dataset
  <li>this is different (and much simpler) from temporal map algebra
</ul>
</section>

<section>
 <h3>Extract crop height time series</h3>
<p>Map algebra can be used to
extract grid cells with elevation above lidar bare ground 
within a selected elevation interval (z1,z2)
